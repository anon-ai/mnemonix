Code of Conduct
===============

Keep a civil tongue, maintain a compassionate disposition, and be respectful when participating in the communities surrounding this project.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to use any means at their disposal to curtail your participation and censor you from said communities if you are found to be aggressively or routinely violating the spirit of this reasonable request. You may or may not be warned before action is taken against you.

Community members who have been subject to or have witnessed any such unacceptable behaviour are urged to contact maintainers through private channels so that it may be addressed. All reports will be kept confidential.

Requests for further clarification of this code and reports of any violations may be addressed directly to [the lead maintainer](mailto:christhekeele+mnemonix@gmail.com). Keep in mind the following heuristic: if you unsure if something is acceptable, it probably isn't.
